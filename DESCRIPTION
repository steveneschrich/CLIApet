Description: This package includes functions used for analysis of the Radiation Sensitivity Index (RSI)
  within a CLIA laboratory. There are a number of visualizations, etc that are required for 
  the report so these are bundled together into this package. These evaluations might be useful to
  other efforts at gene expression-based CLIA validation projects.
